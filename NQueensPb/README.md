NQueens Problem Project

General Description
This project implements a solution to the N-Queens (default is 10 ) problem using OCaml.
The goal is to place n queens on a nxn chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other â€” meaning no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The algorithm uses recursion and backtracking to explore possible configurations until a valid solution is found.

Features

Representation of positions on the board as coordinate pairs (x, y)
Detection of conflicts between queens (same row, column, or diagonal)
Recursive placement of queens using a backtracking approach
Display of the final chessboard solution in the terminal

Prerequisites
OCaml
