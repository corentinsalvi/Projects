3D Chess Game

General description:
The project involves developing a 3D chess game.
It allows a person to play against a well-known chess robot based on the MinMax algorithm: Stockfish.
The aim is to combine the strategic logic of traditional chess with a modern, fluid visual experience.

Main features:
- 3D display of the board and pieces, with the ability to rotate, zoom and move the camera.
- Detection and validation of legal moves according to the official rules of chess.
- Complete game management: moves, captures, check, checkmate and pawn promotion.
- Animation of piece movements and real-time 3D rendering.

Languages used:
Python for game logic.
JavaScript for 3D modelling and rendering.
HTML/CSS for interface and layout.
